introduction: |
  This utility will walk you through creating a package.json file.
  It only covers the most common items, and tries to guess sensible defaults.
  
  See `npm help json` for definitive documentation on these fields
  and exactly what they do.
  
  Use `npm install <pkg> --save` afterwards to install a package and
  save it as a dependency in the package.json file.
  
  Press ^C at any time to quit.
